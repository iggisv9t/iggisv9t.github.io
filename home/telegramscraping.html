        <h1>Digging Telegram</h1>
        <h3>Start</h3>
        <p>I've found <a href="https://antcating.github.io/telegram_connections_frontend/">this</a>
             project and <a href="https://github.com/bellingcat/snscrape">this</a> scraper.
             So I decided to make my own crawler to get 
             a graph of the telegram channels and dig it where I want to.</p>
            <h3>Expectations</h3>
    <p>I started with my channel, so I expected to find some communities around math,
         ML, DS and CS, and other tech channels. But after just a few steps of crawling,
          I've found tons of Russian news channels. Both sides: governmental pro-Putin
           media and independent, which automatically mean oppositional in most cases.</p>

    <p>The purple region on the top is pro-Putin channels and official media, and red -- the opposite. That small blue cluster weakly connected with the main cloud consists of channels written in English. As far as I can see they are about USA and Australia. </p>

        <p>At the same stage, I've found dense networks of news channels for Russian regions. They look extra dense and unnatural.</p>
