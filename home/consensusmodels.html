        <h1>Under Construction</h1>

        <h1>First model</h1>
        <h3>Fully connected group</h3>
        <p>I've heard of such concept that the more people in group,
             the more difficult to reach concensus. Sounds obvious,
              but how fast that difficulty grows with group size?</p>
        <p>I've made a simple model: there is a group of people of size N. 
            They are trying to reach the consensus. At the begining they has no ideas.
            On each iteration each one do one of this actions: with probability A 
            (acceptance rate) the participant accept the idea of random participant 
            from previous iteration. With probability R (rejection rate) the participant 
            decides to leave their own idea from previous step. And finnaly,
             with probability 1-(A+R) they generate a new idea.
             Process stops eather when every participant shares the same idea or
             when the process reach maximum iteration.
        </p>
        <p>I've tried group sizes from 2 to 50 with different A and R.
            Conclusions are not surprizing. The more stubborn are in group 
            the slower convergence. The more "idea generators" in group the 
            faster the process. Even with the most utopian parameters for the 
            group of size 12 is nearly impossible to reach concensus.

        <h1>Second model</h1>
        <p>The same process but not on fully connected group, but on connected networks 
            of fixed sizes but different connectivity. Edges are undirected. I.e 
            nodes interact in both directions.</p>
        <h3>3-nodes graphs</h3>
        <img src="pics/graph3.jpg">
        <p>It looks like "line" took less to reach consensus then "triangle"</p>

        <h3>4-nodes graphs</h3>
        <img src="pics/graph4.jpg">
        <p>It's more interesting with four vertices. They are ordered as time
            to reach consensus grows. Hipothesys are that convergence may
            depend on number of cicles and/or on mean path length. There 
            are also possible waves when part of the network can oscillate.
